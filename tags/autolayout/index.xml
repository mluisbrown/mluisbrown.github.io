      <title>Using PHLivePhotoView with Auto Layout</title>

      <description>So, I was working on updating my app Memories to support displaying Live Photos properly and not just as a static image. I took a look at the documentation for PHLivePhotoView and thought that this would be fairly straightforward. For Live Photos, I&amp;rsquo;ll just use a PHLivePhotoView instead of a UIImageView.
Well, as is usually the case when a developer says: &amp;ldquo;this looks straightforward, I&amp;rsquo;ll have it done in a couple of hours&amp;rdquo;, it was not quite so straightforward and had me scratching my head and cursing until 2am until I finally realised what I was doing wrong.</description>
