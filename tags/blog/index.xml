      <description>My old tumblr blog was a mess. I was doing a very bad impression of being an Apple blogger, interspersed with the odd post about iOS development. The posts were too long and too infrequent. It was actually starting to be an embarrassment.
So I killed it. All the old posts are gone.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting over, with a new blog using the Hugo static blogging engine and hosting everything on GitHub Pages.</description>
